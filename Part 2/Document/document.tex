	\section*{Problem 1: Non-self-supporting Villages}
	Three non-self-supporting villages A, B and C in the middle of nowhere consume one food package each per time unit. The required food packages are delivered by a truck, having a capacity of 300 food packages. The locations of the villages are given, together with the number of time units it takes the truck to travel from one village to another, including loading or delivering. The truck has to pick up its food packages at location S containing an unbounded supply. The villages only have a limited capacity to store food packages: for A and B this capacity is 120, for C it is 200.
	
	\subsection*{Solution:}
	We generalize this problem to $n$ villages and a truck capacity of $C$. We also have a variable $m$ which represents the amount of steps we perform in the model. Each step corresponds to a change in the position of the truck. For each village we then introduce $n * (m+2)$ integer variables $v_{i\_j}$ for $i=1,...,n$ and $j=0,...,m+1$, where $i$ indicates the number of each village and $j$ is the number of steps that have been performed. So now we have a variable $v_{i\_j}$ that represents the amount of food packages in village $i$ after $j$ steps have been performed. Next, we also introduce $m+2$ integer variables $p_j$, $t_j$ and $d_j$ for $j=0,...,m+1$, where $p_j$ represents the position of the truck after $j$ number of steps have been performed, $t_j$ represents the load of the truck after $j$ number of steps have been performed, and $d_j$ represents the amount of food packages that are being delivered at step $j$.\\
	
	Since for each village $i$ the food capacity $v_{i\_j}$ may not exceed its maximum capacity $max_i$, neither may get below zero for any step $j$, we introduce the following formula
\[ \bigwedge_{j=0}^{m+1} \bigwedge_{i=1}^n (v_{i\_j} >= 0) \wedge (v_{i\_j} <= max_i).\]
Where $max_i$ is the maximum capacity of village $i$. In the table below you can see the maximum capacities of villages A, B and C, together with their corresponding integer values.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Maximum capacities of each village}
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\textbf{Village} & \textbf{Corresponding $i$} & \textbf{Maximum capacity} \\ \hline
A	&	1	&	120\\ \hline
B	&	2	&	120\\ \hline
C	&	3	&	200
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

	The position $p_j$ of the truck at each step $j$ should be bounded below by zero and above by the number of villages we have in total. Also the capacity of the truck $t_j$ at each step $j$ should be bounded below by zero and above by the maximum capacity of the truck $C$. Finally, we also need a bound on the capacity that is being delivered $d_j$ at each step $j$, since we can never deliver a negative value. The bounds for these three variables can be represented with the following formula
	\[ \bigwedge_{j=0}^{m+1} (p_j >= 0) \wedge (p_j <= n) \wedge (t_j >= 0) \wedge (t_j <= C) \wedge (d_j >= 0).\]
	Where $m$ is the amount of steps we take, $n$ is the total number of villages (in our case 3), and $C$ is the maximum capacity of the truck.\\

Finally, we need to implement the steps that can be taken at each step of the model. The steps that can be taken depend on the current position of the truck, since in the next step, the truck can only go to neighbouring villages. So let $X_i$ be the set of neighbouring villages of village $i$ and let $f_i(x)$ be a function that determines the costs of going from village $i$ to village $x$. We now can easily express the steps and their corresponding changes in the variables. Since each step contains several variables that need to be updated, we will first give the different parts of the entire formula and explain them. Finally, we will give the entire formula.\\

As said before, the variables of the (immediate) next step depend on the current position of the truck. This is why we have a case distinction on each position in time $p_j$ of the truck. The formula below represents the possibilities for step $j$ and current position $0$
\[ (p_j = i) \Rightarrow \cdots \]
Where $i \in {0,...,n}$ represents the position of the truck at step $j$.\\

Next, we need to define what happens when we know the position of the truck at step $j$, this is what comes after the implication mentioned above. The first thing we observe is the amount of food packages that the truck delivers at step $j$. When the truck is at the supply stack (position 0), we do not deliver anything. This can be represented by the following formula

\[ \cdots ( (d_j = 0) \wedge \cdots \]

But when the truck is at a village, we can deliver any amount of food packages, as long as the current capacity of the village plus the amount we deliver does not exceed the total capacity of that village. So the amount that we deliver to the village should be less than or equal to the maximum capacity of the village minus the current capacity of that village. This can be represented by the following formula

\[ \cdots ( (d_j \leq max(i) - v_{i\_j}) \wedge \cdots \]

After this, we need to define what our next steps can be and what the consequences of taking a specific step are. This can be done by looking at the neighbouring villages of the current position of the truck. If we are at position $i$, then the neighbouring villages of position $i$ are given by the set $X_i$. For the case that the truck is currently at the supply stack (position 0), we again have a special case. Since now the capacity of each village only needs to be reduced in the next step. This needs to be done for each neighbouring village of the current position. This is represented by the following formula

\[ \cdots (\bigvee_{x \in X_0} ((p_{j+1} = x) \wedge \]
\[ (\bigwedge_{1 \leq y \leq n} (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_0(x))) \wedge \cdots \]
Where $x$ indicates the village we can choose next, $y$ indicates all villages, since their supply needs to be reduced, and $f_0(x)$ indicates the amount of time it costs from going from position 0 to village $x$.

When the truck is currently at a village, we can also deliver to that village. So in that case, the supply of that specific village not only gets reduced, but also gets increased again by the amount of food packages we deliver. This can be represented by the following formula

\[ \cdots (\bigvee_{x \in X_i} ((p_{j+1} = x) \wedge \]
\[ (\bigwedge_{1 \leq y \leq n} (((y=i) \wedge (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_i(x) + d_j)) \vee \]
\[ ((y \neq i) \wedge (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_i(x))))) \wedge \cdots \]
Where $x$ indicates the village we can choose next, $y$ indicates all villages, since their supply needs to be reduced, and $f_i(x)$ indicates the amount of time it costs from going from position $i$ to position $x$. We see a distinction between the case that the village from which we are updating the supply is the same as the village we are currently in ($y=i$) and all the other cases ($y \neq i$). When $y=i$ we also add the amount of food packages that we deliver in that step $d_j$ to the supply of that village. The other cases only get their supply being reduced as in the case described above for position 0.

Finally, we also need to set the load of the truck, since this also changes each step. The value of the truck also depends on the village we choose for the next step, since when we are at the supply stack in the next step, we do not deliver anything, but we can increase the load of our truck in that position. In all the other positions, we only can reduce the load of the truck. So we again have a case distinction. When the next position we choose is equal to position 0 ($p_{j+1} = 0$), we get the following formula

\[ \cdots ((p_j{j+1} = 0) \wedge (t_{j+1} \geq t_j))))).\]

When the next position is not the supply stack ($p_{j+1} \neq 0$), we need to reduce the load of the truck by the amount we deliver in that step. This can be represented by the following formula

\[ \cdots ((p_{j+1} \neq 0) \wedge (t_{j+1} = t_j - d_{j+1}))))).\]

So the entire formula for the case that the truck is currently at the supply stack is given below
\[ (p_j = 0) \Rightarrow ( (d_j = 0) \wedge \]
\[ (\bigvee_{x \in X_0} ((p_{j+1} = x) \wedge \]
\[ (\bigwedge_{1 \leq y \leq n} (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_0(x))) \wedge \]
\[ (t_{j+1} = t_j - d_{j+1})))).\]

Similarly, we can also do this for all other positions $i$, but then we only need to add that the delivery changes and that the capacity of the villages also changes if the truck delivers to its village. We can see the possibilities for step $j$ and current position $i \neq 0$ in the formula below

\[ (p_j = i) \Rightarrow ( (d_j \leq max(i) - v_{i\_j}) \wedge \]
\[ (\bigvee_{x \in X_i} ((p_{j+1} = 0) \wedge \]
\[ (\bigwedge_{1 \leq y \leq n} (((y=i) \wedge (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_i(y) + d_j)) \vee \]
\[ ((y \neq i) \wedge (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_i(x))))) \wedge \]
\[ (t_{j+1} \geq t_j)) \vee ((p_{j+1} \neq 0) \wedge \]
\[ (\bigwedge_{1 \leq y \leq n} (((y=i) \wedge (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_i(y) + d_j)) \vee \]
\[ ((y \neq i) \wedge (v_{y\_j+1} = v_{y\_j} - f_i(x))))) \wedge \]
\[ (t_{j+1} = t_j - d_{j+1})))).\]

This formula is quite big and looks impressive, but can easily be expressed in SMT syntax, for instance, for $n=3$, $m=20$ and the connections between the villages are as described in the assignment, one can generate the following SMT code\\

	\subsection*{Problem 1a}
	We need to show that it is impossible to deliver food packages in such a way that each of the villages consumes one food package per time unit forever.
	
	First, we show up until which point it is still possible to deliver food packages. See table \ref{tab:1a}. Any step after step 21 will result in a food shortage.

	\subsection*{Problem 1b}
	%Als er een loop is en we vinden binnen aantal stappen een en in die loop is het mogelijk om te blijven deliveren en je komt in precies dezelfde states weer terug, dan kunnen we oneindig doorgaan.
	For this question we need to show that with a truck capacity of 320 food packages, it is possible to deliver food packages in such a way that the villages consume each one food package per time unit forever.
	
	To solve problems \textbf{b} and \textbf{c}, we need to find a loop that includes a finite amount of legal states. Once we find such a loop, we can repeat it infinitely, and conclude that it is possible to deliver food packages in such a way that each of the villages consumes one food package per time unit forever.
	
	Take two states $i$ and $j$, and take $n$ as the number of villages. Then two states are similar if and only if:
	$$similar(i, j) \Leftrightarrow p_i = p_j \wedge t_i = t_j \wedge \forall (k: 1 \leq k \leq n : v_{k\_i} = v_{k\_j})$$
	
	A loop is defined as a set of succeeding states with a first state $S_i$ and last state $S_j$, where $S_i$ and $S_j$ are similar and $j > i$.
	
	So, if we take $m$ as the number of steps, a solution that holds a loop, can be defined with:
	%$$\exists (i, j: 0 \leq i,j \leq m \wedge j > i: similar(i, j))$$
	
	$$\bigvee_{i, j}^m j > i \wedge similar(i, j)$$
	
	We define a loop in smt as follows. For all $0 \leq i, j \leq m$ with $j > i$ we have {\tt (= p\_$i$ p\_$j$) (= t\_$i$ t\_$j$)}, and for each village $n$, we have: {\tt (= v$n$\_$i$ v$n$\_$j$)}.
